# Project Breakdown #
## As of 11/7/2022 ##
### app.py ###
Can run project in pycharm terminal targeting app.py with: flask --app app --debug run

Currently has navigation support for index, playlist, and add_song

Currently connects to database.db

This file also hosts the functionality for
-  grabbing content from database and displaying that content on index
-  getting content from the add_song page, connecting to the database, and entering the content into it

Started to look into cookie functionality and secret keys and what not, for the information storage of the temporary playlist
