# network-spotify-api-project

Alex Patterson and Jamie Parra  


Project Idea:  

 - For line dancing instructors or practicing dancers to create playlists around the dances they know or need to teach  
  
  

 - Create a database for line dances and the songs that the dances can be done to  

 - Create a wesbite to be able to access/search database  

 - Wesbite should host a temporary small playlist user can add songs to from the seach  

 - Should be able to create a playlist in spotify, export temporary playlist to that playlist  



Using: Spotify API, sqlite3, HTML/CSS, Flask
